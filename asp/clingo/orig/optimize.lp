% Optimization (ordered by priority)

% Perfer low max arity
#minimize {   K@6, K : #max { N,A : a_arity(A, N) } = K }

% Prefer models with minimum sum of actions' cardinalities
#minimize { 1+N@5, A : a_arity(A, N) }.

% Prefer models with minimum sum of (non-static) predicates' cardinalities
#minimize { 1+N@4, P : p_arity(P, N), not p_static(P) }.

% Prefer models with minimum sum of (static) predicates' cardinalities
#minimize {   N@3, P : p_arity(P, N), p_static(P) }.

% Prefer models with minimum number of true atoms per state
#minimize {   N@2, N : bound_on_true_atoms_per_state(N) }.

% Prefer positive preconditions
#minimize {   1@1, prec(A,(P,T),0) }.
